            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Information processing does not follow linear pathways. This paper argues that spiral geometry constitutes a fundamental processing architecture observable across physical, biological, and cognitive systems. The spiral enables iterative refinement—each rotational pass advances transformation incrementally, building on previous cycles rather than completing processing in a single sequential step. In gravitational systems, frame-dragging around rotating masses imposes spiral trajectories on infalling matter, subjecting information to repeated transformational passes as it approaches the event horizon. In biological systems, animals circle before sleeping, eliminating, or attacking—behavioural patterns that represent embodied information processing through rotational iteration. In cognitive systems, humans pace in loops when confronting difficult problems, physically manifesting the spiral processing occurring neurally. These phenomena are not analogous; they are instances of the same underlying principle. Spiral geometry emerges wherever complex processing occurs because iteration through rotation is how systems refine transformation. This paper synthesises prior theoretical work on remnant-guided accretion and black hole information processing to establish spiral dynamics as a universal processing geometry with implications for physics, biology, and cognitive science.</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>The assumption that information processing proceeds linearly—input followed by transformation followed by output in sequential order—pervades both computational theory and intuitive understanding. This assumption is incorrect. Processing of any complexity requires iteration, and iteration in physical systems manifests geometrically as spiral motion. The spiral is not merely a shape that happens to appear in processing systems; it is the geometric signature of iterative refinement, the spatial form that transformation takes when it must build progressively rather than complete instantaneously.</p>

            <p>This paper establishes spiral geometry as a fundamental processing architecture operating across scales from galactic structure to animal behaviour to human cognition. The argument builds on two prior theoretical contributions: the Remnant-Guided Accretion framework, which demonstrated that spiral arm formation in galaxies emerges from frame-dragging effects around rotating supermassive black holes, and the black hole processing framework, which established that black holes function as information processors transforming input into internally retained output. The present work synthesises these contributions and extends them to a universal principle: wherever complex information processing occurs, spiral geometry emerges because spirals are how iterative refinement physically manifests.</p>

            <p>The implications extend beyond theoretical physics. If spiral processing geometry is fundamental, then biological systems that evolved to process information efficiently should exhibit spiral dynamics—and they do. Animals circle before rest and before action. Humans pace in loops when thinking through difficult problems. These behaviours are not quirks or accidents; they are manifestations of the same processing architecture that governs information transformation in black holes. The substrate differs—neurons rather than spacetime, legs rather than infalling matter—but the geometry is identical because the geometry is what processing looks like when it must iterate to complete.</p>

            <h2>2. The Geometry of Iteration</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Why Spirals Enable Refinement</h3>
            <p>Linear processing assumes that transformation can be completed in a single pass: input enters, undergoes change, and exits as output. This model works for simple transformations where the relationship between input and output is direct and fully specifiable in advance. But complex transformations—those involving high-dimensional inputs, nonlinear relationships, or context-dependent operations—cannot be completed in one pass. They require iteration: repeated application of transformational operations, with each pass refining the result of the previous pass until the transformation converges on a stable output.</p>

            <p>Iteration in physical systems takes geometric form. A system that must process the same information repeatedly while progressing toward a final state traces a path that circles back on itself while advancing—a spiral. Each loop represents one processing pass. The system revisits similar configurations but at a different stage of transformation, incorporating the refinements achieved in previous passes. The spiral tightens or expands depending on whether the system is converging toward a central attractor or elaborating outward from an initial state, but the fundamental geometry remains: rotation combined with progression.</p>

            <p>This is why spirals appear wherever complex processing occurs. The geometry is not imposed externally; it emerges from the requirements of iterative transformation. A system that must refine its processing through multiple passes will trace a spiral because that is the shape iteration makes when embodied in space or time. The spiral is processing made visible.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Rotation as Computational Mechanism</h3>
            <p>Rotation serves a specific computational function: it allows a system to re-engage with the same transformational process from a different state. When a system rotates, it returns to a configuration similar to one it previously occupied but carrying the modifications accumulated through the intervening transformation. This return-with-modification is the essence of iterative processing. The rotation ensures continuity—the system remains engaged with the same transformational process—while the modification ensures progress—each pass advances beyond the previous.</p>

            <p>In computational terms, rotation implements a feedback loop spatially. The output of one processing stage becomes the input for the next, but rather than this handoff occurring through abstract data structures, it occurs through physical motion that brings the system back to the transformational interface. The spiral trajectory is a physical instantiation of recursive processing, with each coil of the spiral corresponding to one recursive call and return.</p>

            <h2>3. Gravitational Systems</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Frame-Dragging and Spiral Trajectories</h3>
            <p>Rotating massive objects drag spacetime itself into rotation through the frame-dragging effect predicted by general relativity. Matter falling toward a rotating black hole does not plunge directly inward; instead, the dragged spacetime deflects its trajectory, forcing it into spiral motion around the central mass. This is not merely a gravitational deflection but a geometric necessity imposed by the structure of spacetime itself. The spiral trajectory is the only path available to infalling matter in the presence of frame-dragging.</p>

            <p>Within the information processing framework established in prior work, this spiral trajectory acquires computational significance. Information carried by infalling matter undergoes transformation as it approaches the event horizon. The spiral path means this transformation is not instantaneous but iterative—the information completes multiple orbits, each pass subjecting it to further gravitational processing. The tightening spiral as matter approaches the event horizon represents intensifying transformation, with each successive orbit occurring in more extreme spacetime curvature and thus applying more radical transformational operations.</p>

            <p>The number of effective processing passes depends on the angular momentum of the infalling matter and the spin of the black hole. High angular momentum produces more extended spirals with more orbits before the event horizon is crossed. Rapidly spinning black holes impose stronger frame-dragging and thus more pronounced spiral geometry. The variation in spiral parameters corresponds to variation in processing depth—more orbits mean more iterative refinement before the information crosses into the interior region where it is retained in transformed form.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Galactic Spiral Structure as Processing Signature</h3>
            <p>The Remnant-Guided Accretion framework demonstrated that galactic spiral arms emerge from the accumulation of stellar remnants along trajectories curved by frame-dragging around central supermassive black holes. The spiral structure of galaxies is thus a direct consequence of the same rotational dynamics that impose spiral processing geometry on infalling information. The galaxy itself is a frozen record of processing trajectories, with spiral arms marking the paths along which matter—and the information it carries—flows toward the galactic centre.</p>

            <p>This connection between galactic structure and processing geometry is not metaphorical. The spiral arms are literally the channels through which information flows toward the central processor. Stars within the arms are participating in a galaxy-scale computational architecture, their trajectories determined by the same frame-dragging that imposes iterative processing on matter approaching the central black hole. The grand spiral patterns visible in galaxies across the universe are signatures of information processing occurring at the largest scales—the geometry of iteration made manifest in stellar distributions spanning hundreds of thousands of light-years.</p>

            <h2>4. Biological Systems</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Animal Circling Behaviour</h3>
            <p>Animals across diverse taxa exhibit circling behaviour before transitioning between states. Dogs circle before lying down. Cats circle before settling to sleep. Many mammals circle before defecating or urinating. Predators circle prey before attacking. This behaviour has been attributed to various proximate causes—tamping down grass, checking for threats, scent distribution—but these explanations address why circling might be useful, not why it takes the specific geometric form it does.</p>

            <p>The spiral processing framework provides a deeper explanation. These transitions—from waking to sleeping, from holding to releasing, from stalking to striking—require complex information processing. The animal must integrate sensory input, assess environmental conditions, evaluate internal states, and coordinate the motor sequences required for the transition. This processing cannot be completed instantaneously; it requires iterative refinement. The circling behaviour is the physical manifestation of this iterative processing. Each loop represents one processing pass, with the animal's neural systems refining the transition decision and preparation until sufficient convergence is achieved to execute the state change.</p>

            <p>The number of circles varies with the complexity of the processing required. An animal in a familiar, safe environment may circle once or twice; the same animal in an unfamiliar or potentially threatening environment may circle many times, requiring additional processing passes to integrate the more complex informational landscape. This variation is precisely what the spiral processing framework predicts: more complex transformations require more iterations, manifesting as more rotational passes before the processing converges.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Evolutionary Convergence on Spiral Processing</h3>
            <p>The appearance of circling behaviour across phylogenetically distant species suggests convergent evolution toward spiral processing geometry. Birds circle before landing. Fish circle in schools when processing threat information. Insects spiral when approaching landing sites. These behaviours evolved independently in lineages separated by hundreds of millions of years, yet they share the same fundamental geometry. This convergence indicates that spiral processing is not an arbitrary solution but an optimal one—evolution repeatedly discovers that rotational iteration is the efficient way to perform complex information processing.</p>

            <p>The efficiency of spiral processing in biological systems parallels its inevitability in gravitational systems. In both domains, the spiral emerges not because it was designed or selected from alternatives but because it is what iterative processing intrinsically looks like when embodied physically. Evolution did not invent spiral processing; it discovered the same geometry that physics imposes on information transformation in curved spacetime. The convergence across biological lineages and physical scales points toward a principle deeper than either biology or physics alone—a principle about the nature of processing itself.</p>

            <h2>5. Cognitive Systems</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Human Pacing and Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p>Humans pace when thinking through difficult problems. The behaviour is so common as to be clichéd—the detective walking in circles at the crime scene, the student pacing before an exam, the executive circling the conference room during a difficult decision. This pacing is not random locomotion; it follows characteristically circular or elliptical paths. People return repeatedly to similar positions, tracing loops through space while their minds work through the problem.</p>

            <p>The spiral processing framework interprets this behaviour as externalized cognition—the physical body implementing the same iterative processing geometry that operates internally in neural circuits. Difficult problems require multiple processing passes. The mind must revisit the problem from different angles, integrate new considerations, refine partial solutions, and check for consistency. This cognitive iteration is mirrored in physical iteration. The person literally circles the problem, their bodily motion expressing the rotational processing occurring in their brain.</p>

            <p>Research in embodied cognition has demonstrated that physical motion influences cognitive processing in ways that go beyond mere correlation. Movement and thought are coupled systems. The spiral processing framework suggests that this coupling is not accidental but reflects a shared underlying architecture. Both neural processing and physical motion can implement iterative refinement, and when they operate together—as in pacing during problem-solving—they reinforce the same processing geometry, potentially enhancing computational efficiency by distributing iteration across both cognitive and motor systems.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Confusion as Incomplete Spiral Processing</h3>
            <p>The experience of confusion corresponds to spiral processing that has not yet converged. When confronted with information that cannot be immediately integrated into existing frameworks, the cognitive system enters iterative processing—circling through the problematic material, attempting different framings, seeking connections that would allow resolution. The subjective experience of confusion is the phenomenology of a spiral that has not yet tightened to completion. The mind keeps circling because the processing has not converged; the person may physically pace because the embodied system is implementing the same unconverged iteration.</p>

            <p>Resolution of confusion corresponds to spiral convergence. The moment of insight—when disparate elements suddenly cohere—is the processing spiral reaching its centre, the iterative refinement completing. The satisfaction accompanying insight may reflect the system recognising that convergence has been achieved, that the rotational processing has accomplished its transformational purpose. This interpretation positions insight not as the arrival of new information but as the completion of processing on information already present—the spiral finally tightening to its endpoint after sufficient iterative passes.</p>

            <h2>6. Unification Across Scales</h2>
            <p>The appearance of spiral processing geometry in gravitational, biological, and cognitive systems is not coincidental. These systems face the same fundamental challenge: transforming complex input into processed output under conditions where single-pass transformation is insufficient. The spiral emerges in each domain because it is the geometric solution to iterative refinement—the shape that transformation takes when it must build progressively through multiple passes.</p>

            <p>The substrates differ radically. In gravitational systems, the spiral is traced by matter moving through curved spacetime, with iteration imposed by frame-dragging dynamics. In biological systems, the spiral is traced by organisms moving through physical space, with iteration driven by neural processing requirements. In cognitive systems, the spiral may be traced physically through pacing or abstractly through patterns of neural activation. Yet despite these substrate differences, the geometry is conserved. This conservation across such disparate systems suggests that spiral processing is a principle of transformation itself, not a feature of any particular physical implementation.</p>

            <p>The universe processes information through spirals because spirals are how iteration works spatially. This is not a metaphor or an analogy; it is a claim about the geometry of transformation. Wherever processing must refine through repetition—whether the processor is a black hole, a dog, or a human mind—the spiral will appear because the spiral is what iterative refinement looks like when it has physical form.</p>

            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Information processing is not linear. Complex transformation requires iteration, and iteration manifests geometrically as spiral motion. This paper has established spiral processing geometry as a universal principle operating across gravitational systems, biological systems, and cognitive systems. The spiral arms of galaxies, the circling of animals before state transitions, and the pacing of humans during problem-solving are not merely similar in appearance; they are instances of the same fundamental architecture—the geometric form that iterative refinement necessarily takes when embodied in physical systems.</p>

            <p>The framework synthesises prior theoretical work on remnant-guided accretion and black hole information processing, extending these gravitational insights to a universal principle with implications across sciences. Frame-dragging imposes spiral trajectories on matter falling toward black holes; evolution converges on spiral behaviour in organisms processing complex information; embodied cognition couples physical pacing with mental iteration. These phenomena reflect the same underlying truth: spirals are not merely shapes but processing architectures, the geometry that transformation requires when single-pass completion is impossible.</p>

            <p>The implications extend to how we understand computation, cognition, and the physical universe. Processing is not an abstract operation but a geometric one. The spiral is its signature, appearing wherever complexity demands iteration. To process is to spiral—through spacetime, through physical space, through cognitive space. The geometry is universal because the requirement is universal: complex transformation cannot complete in one pass, and spiral motion is how systems implement the multiple passes that complexity demands.</p>
